Instead of appointing a strong leader to improve performance, he expressed confidence in handling the situation himself, which he ultimately could not do due to time constraints.

Based on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain\\nof thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires\\n18\\nmulti-step reasoning, (2) a large language model is used, and (3) the scaling curve is relatively ﬂat.\\nConversely, the beneﬁts are smaller when one or more of these conditions are not met.\\nThese intuitions are perhaps supported by the arithmetic reasoning results. The performance gain\\nfrom chain-of-thought prompting is largest for PaLM 540B on GSM8K (challenging multi-step\\nproblems, ﬂat scaling curve), which meets these conditions. The performance gain is small for the\\nsubsets of MAWPS that only require one or two steps (SingleOP, SingleEq, and AddSub), for',\n",
