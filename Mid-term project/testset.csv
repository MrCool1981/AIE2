Organizations' use of GAl systems may also warrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.\n\nAl technology can produce varied outputs in multiple modalities and present many classes of user interfaces. This leads to a broader set of AI Actors interacting with GAI systems for widely differing applications and contexts of use. These can include data labeling and preparation, development of GAI models, content moderation, code generation and review, text generation and editing, image and video generation, summarization, search, and chat.

33,What role does digital watermarking play in provenance data tracking for GAI systems?,"['Provenance metadata can include information about GAI model developers or creators of GAI content, date/time of creation, location, modifications, and sources. Metadata can be tracked for text, images, videos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of provenance data tracking techniques can help assess the authenticity, integrity, intellectual property rights, and potential manipulations in digital content. Some well-known techniques for provenance data tracking include digital watermarking, metadata recording, digital fingerprinting, and human authentication, among others.\n\\section*{Provenance Data Tracking Approaches}\nProvenance data tracking techniques for GAI systems can be used to track the history and origin of data inputs, metadata, and synthetic content. Provenance data tracking records the origin and history for digital content, allowing its authenticity to be determined. It consists of techniques to record metadata as well as overt and covert digital watermarks on content. Data provenance refers to tracking the origin and history of input data through metadata and digital watermarking techniques. Provenance data tracking processes can include and assist AI Actors across the lifecycle who may not have full visibility or control over the various trade-offs and cascading impacts of early-stage model decisions on downstream performance and synthetic outputs. For example, by selecting a watermarking model to prioritize robustness (the durability of a watermark), an AI actor may inadvertently diminish computational complexity (the resources required to implement watermarking).

Governance}\n\\section*{A.1.1. Overview}\nLike any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks related to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their existing risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may opt to revise or update Al system risk levels to address these unique GAI risks. This section describes how organizational governance regimes may be reevaluated and adjusted for GAI contexts. It also addresses third-party considerations for governing across the Al value chain.\n\\section*{A.1.2. Organizational Governance}\nGAI opportunities, risks and long-term performance characteristics are typically less well-understood than non-generative Al tools and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. Accordingly, GAI may call for different levels of oversight from AI Actors or different human-AI configurations in order to manage their risks effectively. Organizations' use of GAl systems may also warrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.\n\nAl technology can produce varied outputs in multiple modalities and present many classes of user interfaces. This leads to a broader set of AI Actors interacting with GAI systems for widely differing applications and contexts of use. These can include data labeling and preparation, development of GAI models, content moderation, code generation and review, text generation and editing, image and video generation, summarization, search, and chat.

Results and insights gleaned from these exercises can serve multiple purposes, including improving data quality and preprocessing, bolstering governance decision making, and enhancing system documentation and debugging practices. When implementing feedback activities, organizations should follow human subjects research requirements and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation.\n\\section*{Participatory Engagement Methods}\nOn an ad hoc or more structured basis, organizations can design and use a variety of channels to engage external stakeholders in product development or review. Focus groups with select experts can provide feedback on a range of issues. Small user studies can provide feedback from representative groups or populations. Anonymous surveys can be used to poll or gauge reactions to specific features. Participatory engagement methods are often less structured than field testing or red teaming, and are more commonly used in early stages of AI or product development.\n\\section*{Field Testing}\nField testing involves structured settings to evaluate risks and impacts and to simulate the conditions under which the GAI system will be deployed. Field style tests can be adapted from a focus on user preferences and experiences towards Al risks and impacts - both negative and positive.

37,How does undesired homogenization in GAI systems contribute to unreliable decision-making and amplification of harmful biases?,"['Harmful bias in GAI systems can also lead to harms via disparities between how a model performs for different subgroups or languages (e.g., an LLM may perform less well for non-English languages or certain dialects). Such disparities can contribute to discriminatory decision-making or amplification of existing societal biases. In addition, GAI systems may be inappropriately trusted to perform similarly across all subgroups, which could leave the groups facing underperformance with worse outcomes than if no GAI system were used. Disparate or reduced performance for lower-resource languages also presents challenges to model adoption, inclusion, and accessibility, and may make preservation of endangered languages more difficult if GAI systems become embedded in everyday processes that would otherwise have been opportunities to use these languages.\n\nBias is mutually reinforcing with the problem of undesired homogenization, in which GAI systems produce skewed distributions of outputs that are overly uniform (for example, repetitive aesthetic styles\\\\\nand reduced content diversity). Overly homogenized outputs can themselves be incorrect, or they may lead to unreliable decision-making or amplify harmful biases. These phenomena can flow from foundation models to downstream models and systems, with the foundation models acting as ""bottlenecks,"" or single points of failure.\n\nOverly homogenized content can contribute to ""model collapse."" Model collapse can occur when model training over-relies on synthetic data, resulting in data points disappearing from the distribution of the new model\'s outputs. In addition to threatening the robustness of the model overall, model collapse could lead to homogenized outputs, including by amplifying any homogenization from the model used to generate the synthetic training data.']","Undesired homogenization in GAI systems contributes to unreliable decision-making and amplification of harmful biases by producing skewed distributions of outputs that are overly uniform.

Generative AI models can also assist malicious actors in creating compelling imagery and propaganda to support disinformation campaigns, which may not be photorealistic, but could enable these campaigns to gain more reach and engagement on social media platforms.

The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or biological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and infrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key barriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI can help actors address those barriers.\n\nFurthermore, chemical and biological design tools (BDTs) - highly specialized Al systems trained on scientific data that aid in chemical and biological design - may augment design capabilities in chemistry and biology beyond what text-based LLMs are able to provide. As these models become more efficacious, including for beneficial uses, it will be important to assess their potential to be used for harm, such as the ideation and design of novel harmful chemical or biological agents.\n\nWhile some of these described capabilities lie beyond the reach of existing GAI tools, ongoing assessments of this risk would be enhanced by monitoring both the ability of AI tools to facilitate CBRN weapons planning and GAI systems' connection or access to relevant data and tools.""]",LLM outputs regarding biological threat creation and attack planning provided minimal assistance beyond traditional search engine queries.,simple,[{'source': 'data/nist_ai.tex'}],True

58,How do GAI vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt injection and data poisoning intersect with privacy risks from data memorization and PII inference?,"['Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Safe, Valid and Reliable, Interpretable and Explainable\n\\subsection*{2.9. Information Security}\nInformation security for computer systems and data is a mature field with widely accepted and standardized practices for offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. GAI-based systems present two primary information security risks: GAI could potentially discover or enable new cybersecurity risks by lowering the barriers for or easing automated exercise of offensive capabilities; simultaneously, it expands the available attack surface, as GAI itself is vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection or data poisoning.\n\nOffensive cyber capabilities advanced by GAI systems may augment cybersecurity attacks such as hacking, malware, and phishing. Reports have indicated that LLMs are already able to discover some vulnerabilities in systems (hardware, software, data) and write code to exploit them. Sophisticated threat actors might further these risks by developing GAI-powered security co-pilots for use in several parts of the attack chain, including informing attackers on how to proactively evade threat detection and escalate privileges after gaining system access.\n\nInformation security for GAI models and systems also includes maintaining availability of the GAI system and the integrity and (when applicable) the confidentiality of the GAI code, training data, and model weights. To identify and secure potential attack points in Al systems or specific components of the AI\\\\\n${ }^{12}$ See also \\href{https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-4}{https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-4}, to be published.\\\\\nvalue chain (e.g., data inputs, processing, GAI training, or deployment environments), conventional cybersecurity practices may need to adapt or evolve.', 'Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Safe, Secure and Resilient\n\\subsection*{2.4. Data Privacy}\nGAI systems raise several risks to privacy. GAI system training requires large volumes of data, which in some cases may include personal data. The use of personal data for GAI training raises risks to widely accepted privacy principles, including to transparency, individual participation (including consent), and purpose specification. For example, most model developers do not disclose specific data sources on which models were trained, limiting user awareness of whether personally identifiably information (PII) was trained on and, if so, how it was collected.\n\nModels may leak, generate, or correctly infer sensitive information about individuals. For example, during adversarial attacks, LLMs have revealed sensitive information (from the public domain) that was included in their training data. This problem has been referred to as data memorization, and may pose exacerbated privacy risks even for data present only in a small number of training samples.\n\nIn addition to revealing sensitive information in GAI training data, GAI models may be able to correctly infer PII or sensitive data that was not in their training data nor disclosed by the user by stitching together information from disparate sources. These inferences can have negative impact on an individual even if the inferences are not accurate (e.g., confabulations), and especially if they reveal information that the individual considers sensitive or that is used to disadvantage or harm them.\n\nBeyond harms from information exposure (such as extortion or dignitary harm), wrong or inappropriate inferences of PII can contribute to downstream or secondary harmful impacts. For example, predictive inferences made by GAI models based on PII or protected attributes can contribute to adverse decisions, leading to representational or allocative harms to individuals or groups (see Harmful Bias and Homogenization below).']","GAI vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt injection and data poisoning intersect with privacy risks from data memorization and PII inference by potentially revealing sensitive information included in training data during adversarial attacks. These vulnerabilities can lead to the exposure of PII or sensitive data, which can be inferred even if not present in the training data, causing privacy risks and potential harm to individuals.",multi_context,"[{'source': 'data/nist_ai.tex'}, {'source': 'data/nist_ai.tex'}]",True

As a result, human experts may be unnecessarily ""averse"" to GAI systems, and thus deprive themselves or others of GAl\'s beneficial uses.\n\nConversely, due to the complexity and increasing reliability of GAI technology, over time, humans may over-rely on GAI systems or may unjustifiably perceive GAI content to be of higher quality than that produced by other sources. This phenomenon is an example of automation bias, or excessive deference to automated systems. Automation bias can exacerbate other risks of GAI , such as risks of confabulation or risks of bias or homogenization.\n\nThere may also be concerns about emotional entanglement between humans and GAI systems, which could lead to negative psychological impacts.', 'There may also be concerns about emotional entanglement between humans and GAI systems, which could lead to negative psychological impacts.\n\nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Explainable and Interpretable, Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Valid and Reliable\n\\subsection*{2.8.

The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or biological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and infrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key barriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI can help actors address those barriers.\n\nFurthermore, chemical and biological design tools (BDTs) - highly specialized Al systems trained on scientific data that aid in chemical and biological design - may augment design capabilities in chemistry and biology beyond what text-based LLMs are able to provide. As these models become more efficacious, including for beneficial uses, it will be important to assess their potential to be used for harm, such as the ideation and design of novel harmful chemical or biological agents.\n\nWhile some of these described capabilities lie beyond the reach of existing GAI tools, ongoing assessments of this risk would be enhanced by monitoring both the ability of AI tools to facilitate CBRN weapons planning and GAI systems' connection or access to relevant data and tools."", ""}\noperations, or other cyberattacks; increased attack surface for targeted cyberattacks, which may compromise a system's availability or the confidentiality or integrity of training data, code, or model weights.\\\\\n10.

Metadata can be tracked for text, images, videos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of provenance data tracking techniques can help assess the authenticity, integrity, intellectual property rights, and potential manipulations in digital content. Some well-known techniques for provenance data tracking include digital watermarking, metadata recording, digital fingerprinting, and human authentication, among others.\n\\section*{Provenance Data Tracking Approaches}\nProvenance data tracking techniques for GAI systems can be used to track the history and origin of data inputs, metadata, and synthetic content. Provenance data tracking records the origin and history for digital content, allowing its authenticity to be determined. It consists of techniques to record metadata as well as overt and covert digital watermarks on content. Data provenance refers to tracking the origin and history of input data through metadata and digital watermarking techniques. Provenance data tracking processes can include and assist AI Actors across the lifecycle who may not have full visibility or control over the various trade-offs and cascading impacts of early-stage model decisions on downstream performance and synthetic outputs. For example, by selecting a watermarking model to prioritize robustness (the durability of a watermark), an AI actor may inadvertently diminish computational complexity (the resources required to implement watermarking). Organizational risk management efforts for enhancing content provenance include:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Tracking provenance of training data and metadata for GAI systems;\n  \\item Documenting provenance data limitations within GAI systems;\n  \\item Monitoring system capabilities and limitations in deployment through rigorous TEVV processes;', '\\item Human / AI: Performed by GAI in combination with specialist or non-specialist human teams.

Some aspects of GAI outputs, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to distinguish human-generated content from Al-generated synthetic content. To help manage and mitigate these risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and history of content. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater information access about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of trustworthiness in Al systems. When combined with other organizational accountability mechanisms, digital content transparency approaches can enable processes to trace negative outcomes back to their source, improve information integrity, and uphold public trust.

73,How do GAI systems' cyber threats and privacy risks affect trustworthiness?,"['Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Safe, Valid and Reliable, Interpretable and Explainable\n\\subsection*{2.9. Information Security}\nInformation security for computer systems and data is a mature field with widely accepted and standardized practices for offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. GAI-based systems present two primary information security risks: GAI could potentially discover or enable new cybersecurity risks by lowering the barriers for or easing automated exercise of offensive capabilities; simultaneously, it expands the available attack surface, as GAI itself is vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection or data poisoning.\n\nOffensive cyber capabilities advanced by GAI systems may augment cybersecurity attacks such as hacking, malware, and phishing. Reports have indicated that LLMs are already able to discover some vulnerabilities in systems (hardware, software, data) and write code to exploit them. Sophisticated threat actors might further these risks by developing GAI-powered security co-pilots for use in several parts of the attack chain, including informing attackers on how to proactively evade threat detection and escalate privileges after gaining system access.\n\nInformation security for GAI models and systems also includes maintaining availability of the GAI system and the integrity and (when applicable) the confidentiality of the GAI code, training data, and model weights. To identify and secure potential attack points in Al systems or specific components of the AI\\\\\n${ }^{12}$ See also \\href{https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-4}{https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-4}, to be published.\\\\\nvalue chain (e.g., data inputs, processing, GAI training, or deployment environments), conventional cybersecurity practices may need to adapt or evolve.', 'Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Safe, Secure and Resilient\n\\subsection*{2.4. Data Privacy}\nGAI systems raise several risks to privacy. GAI system training requires large volumes of data, which in some cases may include personal data. The use of personal data for GAI training raises risks to widely accepted privacy principles, including to transparency, individual participation (including consent), and purpose specification. For example, most model developers do not disclose specific data sources on which models were trained, limiting user awareness of whether personally identifiably information (PII) was trained on and, if so, how it was collected.\n\nModels may leak, generate, or correctly infer sensitive information about individuals. For example, during adversarial attacks, LLMs have revealed sensitive information (from the public domain) that was included in their training data. This problem has been referred to as data memorization, and may pose exacerbated privacy risks even for data present only in a small number of training samples.\n\nIn addition to revealing sensitive information in GAI training data, GAI models may be able to correctly infer PII or sensitive data that was not in their training data nor disclosed by the user by stitching together information from disparate sources. These inferences can have negative impact on an individual even if the inferences are not accurate (e.g., confabulations), and especially if they reveal information that the individual considers sensitive or that is used to disadvantage or harm them.\n\nBeyond harms from information exposure (such as extortion or dignitary harm), wrong or inappropriate inferences of PII can contribute to downstream or secondary harmful impacts. For example, predictive inferences made by GAI models based on PII or protected attributes can contribute to adverse decisions, leading to representational or allocative harms to individuals or groups (see Harmful Bias and Homogenization below).']","GAI systems' cyber threats and privacy risks affect trustworthiness by presenting new cybersecurity risks, expanding the attack surface, and potentially leaking or inferring sensitive information.

Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor when integrating GAI into applications involving consequential decision making.\n\nGAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations that purport to justify or explain the system's answer, which may further mislead humans into inappropriately trusting the system's output. For instance, LLMs sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the answer itself is incorrect. Similarly, an LLM could falsely assert that it is human or has human traits, potentially deceiving humans into believing they are speaking with another human.\n\nThe extent to which humans can be deceived by LLMs, the mechanisms by which this may occur, and the potential risks from adversarial prompting of such behavior are emerging areas of study. Given the wide range of downstream impacts of GAI, it is difficult to estimate the downstream scale and impact of confabulations.\n\nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Safe, Valid and Reliable, Explainable and Interpretable\n\\subsection*{2.3. Dangerous, Violent, or Hateful Content}\nGAI systems can produce content that is inciting, radicalizing, or threatening, or that glorifies violence, with greater ease and scale than other technologies. LLMs have been reported to generate dangerous or violent recommendations, and some models have generated actionable instructions for dangerous or"", '\\footnotetext{${ }^{9}$ Confabulations of falsehoods are most commonly a problem for text-based outputs; for audio, image, or video content, creative generation of non-factual content can be a desired behavior.\\\\\n${ }^{10}$ For example, legal confabulations have been shown to be pervasive in current state-of-the-art LLMs. See also, e.g.,\n}\nunethical behavior. Text-to-image models also make it easy to create images that could be used to promote dangerous or violent messages. Similar concerns are present for other GAI media, including video and audio. GAI may also produce content that recommends self-harm or criminal/illegal activities.\nMany current systems restrict model outputs to limit certain content or in response to certain prompts, but this approach may still produce harmful recommendations in response to other less-explicit, novel prompts (also relevant to CBRN Information or Capabilities, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Obscene, Degrading and/or Abusive Content). Crafting such prompts deliberately is known as ""Â¡ailbreaking,"" or, manipulating prompts to circumvent output controls. Limitations of GAI systems can be harmful or dangerous in certain contexts. Studies have observed that users may disclose mental health issues in conversations with chatbots - and that users exhibit negative reactions to unhelpful responses from these chatbots during situations of distress.\n\nThis risk encompasses difficulty controlling creation of and public exposure to offensive or hateful language, and denigrating or stereotypical content generated by AI. This kind of speech may contribute to downstream harm such as fueling dangerous or violent behaviors. The spread of denigrating or stereotypical content can also further exacerbate representational harms (see Harmful Bias and Homogenization below).']","GAI confabulations can worsen risks in critical decisions by causing users to believe false content due to the confident nature of the response, leading to incorrect actions or recommendations. In healthcare, for example, confabulated summaries of patient information could result in incorrect diagnoses or treatments. Additionally, GAI outputs may include confabulated logic or citations that mislead humans into trusting the system's output inappropriately. This can be particularly dangerous in applications involving consequential decision-making. Furthermore, GAI systems can produce inciting, radicalizing, or threatening content, and generate dangerous or violent recommendations, which can contribute to harmful behaviors and exacerbate representational harms.",multi_context,"[{'source': 'data/nist_ai.tex'}, {'source': 'data/nist_ai.tex'}]",True

Value Chain and Component Integration}\nGAI value chains involve many third-party components such as procured datasets, pre-trained models, and software libraries. These components might be improperly obtained or not properly vetted, leading to diminished transparency or accountability for downstream users. While this is a risk for traditional AI systems and some other digital technologies, the risk is exacerbated for GAI due to the scale of the training data, which may be too large for humans to vet; the difficulty of training foundation models, which leads to extensive reuse of limited numbers of models; and the extent to which GAI may be integrated into other devices and services. As GAI systems often involve many distinct third-party components and data sources, it may be difficult to attribute issues in a system\'s behavior to any one of these sources.\n\nErrors in third-party GAI components can also have downstream impacts on accuracy and robustness. For example, test datasets commonly used to benchmark or validate models can contain label errors. Inaccuracies in these labels can impact the ""stability"" or robustness of these benchmarks, which many GAI practitioners consider during the model selection process.', 'How GAI relates to copyright, including the status of generated content that is similar to but does not strictly copy work protected by copyright, is currently being debated in legal fora. Similar discussions are taking place regarding the use or emulation of personal identity, likeness, or voice without permission.\n\nTrustworthy Al Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Privacy Enhanced\n\\subsection*{2.11. Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content}\nGAI can ease the production of and access to illegal non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) of adults, and/or child sexual abuse material (CSAM). GAI-generated obscene, abusive or degrading content can create privacy, psychological and emotional, and even physical harms, and in some cases may be illegal.\n\nGenerated explicit or obscene AI content may include highly realistic ""deepfakes"" of real individuals, including children. The spread of this kind of material can have downstream negative consequences: in the context of CSAM, even if the generated images do not resemble specific individuals, the prevalence of such images can divert time and resources from efforts\\_to find real-world victims. Outside of CSAM, the creation and spread of NCII disproportionately impacts women and sexual minorities, and can have subsequent negative consequences including decline in overall mental health, substance abuse, and even suicidal thoughts.\n\nData used for training GAI models may unintentionally include CSAM and NCII. A recent report noted that several commonly used GAI training datasets were found to contain hundreds of known images of\n\nCSAM.
