        "**Multiple Negative Ranking Loss (MNRL)** is a machine learning technique designed to enhance model training by contrasting positive samples with multiple negative samples, improving differentiation between relevant and irrelevant data. It minimizes the distance between a query and positive samples while maximizing it with multiple negative ones, offering a more nuanced learning process, particularly in complex scenarios like recommendation systems, ad targeting, and information retrieval. MNRL boosts discriminative power, generalization, and scalability, but its challenges include complexity in selecting negative samples and increased computational demands. Its applications span fields like natural language processing, search engine optimization, and user engagement prediction.\n",

        "Reference: [Multiple Negative Ranking Loss (MNRL) Explained](https://medium.com/@aisagescribe/multiple-negative-ranking-loss-mnrl-explained-5b4741e38d8f)\n",

        "**Matryoshka Loss** is inspired by Matryoshka dolls (nested dolls of decreasing size) and is designed to work with embeddings of varying dimensions. It's structured to optimize embeddings at multiple levels of granularity (higher and lower-dimensional embeddings), which can help improve generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mechanism: It works by optimizing the embeddings to maintain consistency across different dimensions. For instance, it ensures that a higher-dimensional embedding (e.g., 768-dim) contains more fine-grained information while a lower-dimensional embedding (e.g., 64-dim) is more abstract but consistent with the higher-dimensional embedding.\n",
        "- Objective: The loss ensures that embeddings at all levels (from high-dimensional to low-dimensional) preserve a consistent relational structure. This enables the model to compress information without losing important relational properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Why Use These Losses Together?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss helps to optimize the quality of embeddings by contrasting positive and negative examples, while the Matryoshka Loss ensures that embeddings of different dimensionalities remain consistent. When combined, they help train a model that produces both effective and scalable embeddings across different dimensions."
